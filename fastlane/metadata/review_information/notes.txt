This app is a companion app to the Knuff Mac app.
We tried to submit that to the Mac App Store a while ago but they required a demo account, even if it is a standalone app as well.
Therefore we are now trying to submit this app so the peoples that reviewing the mac app can use this as demo.

To test this iOS app you need the mac one, that one can be downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/KnuffApp/Knuff/releases (OS X El Capitan is required)
iOS: Start the app, register for remote notifications by taping "GET STARTED"
OS X:
1: Switch to "Knuff iOS App"
2: Make sure to be on the same WiFi, select your phone in the list when clicked "Devices"-button, you will then get a token
3: Press "Push", it might take a few seconds for the first push message to get to the phone, note that you have to have the iOS app in the background while pushing to get a visible notification
